Pass heat maps
===========================

Make a heat map of all teams passes during a tournament.
We set a window for danger passes to be those in 15 seconds leading up to a shot.

# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# At first we have to open the data. To do this we use a parser SBopen available in mplsoccer. 
# Using method *match* and putting the id of the season and competition
# To get games by England Women's team we need to filter them in a dataframe - if they played as a home or away team.
# We als calculate number of games to normalize the diagrams later on

#open the data
parser = Sbopen()
df_match = parser.match(competition_id=72, season_id=30)
#our team
team = "England Women's"
#get list of games by our team, either home or away
match_ids = df_match.loc[(df_match["home_team_name"] == team) | (df_match["away_team_name"] == team)]["match_id"].tolist()
#calculater number of games
no_games = len(match_ids)

# Finding danger passes
# ----------------------------
# First, for each game using mplsoccer parser we open the event data. Note that we use the [0] to store only event data. 
# Then, for each period in the game we take out shots by England and accurate passes by England that were not set pieces.
# We look for the passes 15 seconds before a shot. That is why we iterate for different periods. If a shot was made in 46th minute
# and there were 3 additional minutes in the first half, we would include those passes. Having the danger passes we concatenate them 
# with a pandas dataframe to store danger passes from all games 

#declaere an empty dataframe
danger_passes = pd.DataFrame()
for idx in match_ids:
    #open the event data from this game 
    df = parser.event(idx)[0]
    for period in [1, 2]:
        #keep only accurate passes by England that were not set pieces in this period
        mask_pass = (df.team_name == team) & (df.type_name == "Pass") & (df.outcome_name.isnull()) & (df.period == period) & (df.sub_type_name.isnull()) 
        #keep only necessary columns
        passes = df.loc[mask_pass, ["x", "y", "end_x", "end_y", "minute", "second", "player_name"]]
        #keep only Shots by England in this period
        mask_shot = (df.team_name == team) & (df.type_name == "Shot") & (df.period == period)
        #keep only necessary columns
        shots = df.loc[mask_shot, ["minute", "second"]]
        #convert time to seconds
        shot_times = shots['minute']*60+shots['second']
        shot_window = 15  
        #find starts of the window
        shot_start = shot_times - shot_window
        #condition to avoid negative shot starts
        shot_start = shot_start.apply(lambda i: i if i>0 else (period-1)*45)
        #convert to seconds
        pass_times = passes['minute']*60+passes['second']
        #check if pass is in any of the windows for this half

# Plotting location of danger passes
# ----------------------------
# First, we create a pitch using mplsoccer *Pitch* class. Then we scatter them using scatter method. 
# If you want to investigate the direction of passes, uncomment a line below!

#plot pitch
pitch = Pitch(line_color='black')
fig, ax = pitch.grid(grid_height=0.9, title_height=0.06, axis=False,
                     endnote_height=0.04, title_space=0, endnote_space=0)
#scatter the location on the pitch
pitch.scatter(danger_passes.x, danger_passes.y, s=100, color='blue', edgecolors='grey', linewidth=1, alpha=0.2, ax=ax["pitch"])
#uncomment it to plot arrows
#pitch.arrows(danger_passes.x, danger_passes.y, danger_passes.end_x, danger_passes.end_y, color = "blue", ax=ax['pitch'])
#add title
fig.suptitle('Location of danger passes by ' + team, fontsize = 30)
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# Making a heat map
# ----------------------------
# To make a heat map, first, we draw a pitch. Then we calculate the number of passes in each bin using *bin_statistic* method.
# Then, we normalize number of passes by number of games. We plot a heat map and then, we make a legend. As the last step we add 
# the title. 

#plot vertical pitch
pitch = VerticalPitch(line_zorder=2, line_color='black')
fig, ax = pitch.grid(grid_height=0.9, title_height=0.06, axis=False,
                     endnote_height=0.04, title_space=0, endnote_space=0)
#get the 2D histogram 
bin_statistic = pitch.bin_statistic(danger_passes.x, danger_passes.y, statistic='count', bins=(6, 5), normalize=False)
#normalize by number of games
bin_statistic["statistic"] = bin_statistic["statistic"]/no_games
#make a heatmap
pcm  = pitch.heatmap(bin_statistic, cmap='Reds', edgecolor='grey', ax=ax['pitch'])
#legend to our plot
ax_cbar = fig.add_axes((1, 0.093, 0.03, 0.786))
cbar = plt.colorbar(pcm, cax=ax_cbar)
fig.suptitle('Danger passes by ' + team + " per game", fontsize = 30)
plt.show()


##############################################################################
# Making a diagram of most involved players
# ----------------------------
# To find out who was the most involved in dnager passes, we keep only surnames of players to make the vizualisation clearer.
# Then, we group the passes by the player and count them. Also, we divide them by number of games to keep the diagram per game.
# As the last step, we make the legend to our diagram 

#keep only surnames
danger_passes["player_name"] = danger_passes["player_name"].apply(lambda x: str(x).split()[-1])
#count passes by player and normalize them
pass_count = danger_passes.groupby(["player_name"]).x.count()/no_games
#make a histogram
ax = pass_count.plot.bar(pass_count, rot = 90)
#make legend
ax.set_xlabel("")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of danger passes per game")
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# Challenge
# ----------------------------
# 1) Improve so that only high xG (>0.07) are included!
# 2) Make a heat map only for Sweden's player (Sweden Women's) who was the most involved in danger passes!
