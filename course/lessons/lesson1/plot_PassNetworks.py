Here we look at how to create a passing network and measure
centralisation. Is one player hogging the ball?

# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# The event data is stored in a dataframe *df* as usual.

parser = Sbopen()
df, related, freeze, tactics = parser.event(69301)

##############################################################################
# Preparing the data
# ----------------------------
# For passing networks we use only accurate/successful passes made by a team until the first substitution.
# This is mainly just to get going and there are several possible variations of this.
# We need information about pass start and end location as well as player who made and received the pass. 
# To make the vizualisation clearer, we annotate the players using their surname.
# (This works for English women side, since players' surnames  are single-barrelled. But
# can cause problems.For example, Leo Messi's name in Statsbomb is Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. So the
# name Cuccittini will come up if you run this code on his matches!).

#check for index of first sub
sub = df.loc[df["type_name"] == "Substitution"].loc[df["team_name"] == "England Women's"].iloc[0]["index"]
#make df with successfull passes by England until the first substitution
mask_england = (df.type_name == 'Pass') & (df.team_name == "England Women's") & (df.index < sub) & (df.outcome_name.isnull()) & (df.sub_type_name != "Throw-in")
#taking necessary columns
df_pass = df.loc[mask_england, ['x', 'y', 'end_x', 'end_y', "player_name", "pass_recipient_name"]]
#adjusting that only the surname of a player is presented.
df_pass["player_name"] = df_pass["player_name"].apply(lambda x: str(x).split()[-1])
df_pass["pass_recipient_name"] = df_pass["pass_recipient_name"].apply(lambda x: str(x).split()[-1])

# Calculating vertices size and location
# ----------------------------
# To calculate vertices size and location, first we create an empty dataframe.
# For each player we calculate average location of passes made and receptions.
# Then, we calculate number of passes made by each player.
# As the last step, we calculate set he marker size to be proportional to number of passes.

#adjust the size of a circle so that the player who made more passes 
scatter_df['marker_size'] = (scatter_df['no'] / scatter_df['no'].max() * 1500)

##############################################################################
# Calculating edges width
# ----------------------------
# To calculate edge width we again look at the number of passes between players
# We need to group the dataframe of passes by the combination of passer and recipient and count passes between them.
# As the last step, we set the threshold ignoring players that made fewer than 2 passes.
# You can try different thresholds and investigate how the passing network changes when you change it.
# It is recommended that you tune this depedning on the message behind your visualisation.

#counting passes between players

# Plotting vertices
# ----------------------------

# Plotting edges
# ----------------------------
# For each combination of players who made passes, we make a query to *scatter_df* to get the start and end of the line.
# Then we adjust the line width so that the more passes between players, the wider the line.
# As the next step, we plot the lines on the pitch. It is recommended that zorder of edges is lower than zorder of vertices.
# In the end, we make the title.

#plot once again pitch and vertices

# Centralisation
# ----------------------------
# To calculate the centralisation index we need to calculate number of passes made by each player. 
# Then, we calculate the denominator - the sum of all passes multiplied by (number of players - 1) -> 10
# To calculate the numerator we sum the difference between maximal number of successful passes by 1 player
# and number of successful passes by each player. We calculate the index dividing the numerator by denominator.

#calculate number of successful passes by player
no_passes = df_pass.groupby(['player_name']).x.count().reset_index()
no_passes.rename({'x':'pass_count'}, axis='columns', inplace=True)
#find one who made most passes
max_no = no_passes["pass_count"].max() 
#calculate the denominator - 10*the total sum of passes
denominator = 10*no_passes["pass_count"].sum() 
#calculate the nominator
nominator = (max_no - no_passes["pass_count"]).sum()
#calculate the centralisation index
centralisation_index = nominator/denominator
print("Centralisation index is ", centralisation_index)
