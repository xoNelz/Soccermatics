# Opening data 
# ----------------------------
# In this section of the course we will implement the Expected Threat model it the same way
# as `Karun Singh did on his blog <https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html>`_. First, we
# open the data.

# Actions moving the ball 
# ----------------------------
# To calculate the Expected Threat we need actions that moved the ball. First we filter them 
# from the database. Then, we remove dodgy passes, inaccurate ones that ended in [0,0] or [1,1].
# To make our calculations easier we create new columns with coordinates, one for each coordinate.
# Then, we plot the location of actions moving the ball on 2D histogram.
# Note that dribblings are also actions that move the ball. However, Wyscout does not store them in 
# the v2 version that we are using in the course and not all ground attacking duels are dribblings.
# In the end we store number of actions in each bin in a *move_count* array to calculate later
# move probability.

# we calculate the probability of transfering the ball from it to all 192 sectors on the pitch. 
# given that the ball was moved. We do it as the division of events that went to end sector
