"""
Expected Goals with player position
=====================

In this lesson, we go step-by-step through the process of making expected goals model
with additional information concerning opposition player location. This tutorial
follows similar design choices as Javier Fernandez's expected goals model in 
`A framework for the fine-grained evaluation of the instantaneous expected value of soccer possessions <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-05989-6>`_.
We will train a shallow neural network with following features
- ball location (x)
- binary variable signifying if ball was closer to the goal than the opponent's goalkeeper
- angle between the ball and the goal
- distance between the ball and the goal
- distance between the ball and the goalkeeper in y-axis
- distance between the ball and the goalkeeper
- number of opponent players inside the triangle formed between the ball location and opponent's goal posts
- number of opponent players less than 3 meters away from the ball location
- binary variable signifying if shot was a header
- expected goals based on distance to goal and angle between the ball and the goal

# Training neural network

# Having the features created we can now train a neural network. We split the data 60% training, 20% validation and 20% test. Then, we scale inputs.

# by a ReLU activation and a final layer size 1 with sigmoid activation to compute the probabilities. Our model optimizes the Brier score using Adam
# optimizer with learning rate 0.001 default betas. We use as suggested early stopping with minimum delta 1e-5 and batch size 16. However, we also use patience
# equal to 50 not to stop the first time when the validation loss is not changing.
